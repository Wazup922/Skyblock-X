# Dont change World-Name and Distance-Between-Islands once players start using the world and creating islands, otherwise things will get messy!

# World-Name is the name of the world that will be generated by Skyblock X for player islands
World-Name: SkyblockX

# Distance-Between-Islands is the distance between the center of islands. Keep this value somewhat high so that players on nearby islands do not see each other
Distance-Between-Islands: 1000

# Should the plugin use players UUID for saving their data? Use this in premium servers
Use-Players-UUID-For-Saving-Data: false

# Use this if you want players to have separate inventory, health, and other conditions when they join Skyblock X
# If you would like players to have 1 inventory and conditions at all times, keep this as false.
# You can also set this to false and use other plugins to achieve the same effect. Other plugins may include PerWorldInventory as an example.
Change-Player-Conditions-Upon-Join: false

Islands-Y-Coordinate: 60
